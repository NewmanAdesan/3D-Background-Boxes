  Three main concepts outlines the foundation of this project
  - background image decentralization
  - transistion via class naming
  - 3d box modelling with `::before` and `::after`
  
  
  # Concept 1: background image decentralization
  basically we have 16 different elements of equal size (height & width)
  using the same background image. 
  
  Since the is bigger in size than the element,
  each element shows a part of the background image
  
  This is implemented with the CSS properties
  `background-image`, `background-size`, `background-positioning`
